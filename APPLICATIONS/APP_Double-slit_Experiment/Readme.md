# Double-slit experiment


Light can behave characteristics of both waves and particles. We developed a very easy-to-use setup to demonstrate the classical double-slit experiment sometimes referred to as Young's experiment or Young's slits.

In the experiment, a wave is split into two separate waves and later they are combined into a single wave. The path lengths of both waves are different and have a phase shift which creates an interference pattern. The [Mach–Zehnder interferometer,](../APPLICATIONS/APP_Mach-Zehnder_Interferometer) is an another version which splits the beam with a mirror.

#### Preparing Single-slit and Double-slit

It's easy to prepare our Single-Slit and Double-Slit slides at home with basic equipments:
+ Aluminum foil
+ Sharp knife (Keep your fingers safe   :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed: )
+ Four microscope slides (optional)
+ tape

</p>

Steps of preparing slides:
1. Take a small piece of aluminum foil.
2. Cut thin slit (or two slit next to each other) with your knife.
3. Use this foil with your sample holder directly.
4. (OPTIONAL) Insert aluminum foil piece between 2 microscope slides and tape two edges with tape.

And you have two new products and I called them as Single-Slit Slide and Double-Slit slide. Feel free to give a special name like Zombie :zombie: and genie :genie:

In the photo, there are three single-slits in the left slide and each single-slit has different width.
In the right slide there are three double-slits pairs  and each double-slits has different distance between each other.

ADDITIONAL INFO: Our slits are done with a laser cutting machine. It's also an option for people who have access to maker space or something like that. Because with a knife and by hand making slits of different width could be harder.

Let's put slides into the cube.
