## Align the camera
In the openSIM setup, the camera module is arranged on the bottom layer, therefore, it needs to be aligned first. Try to find a far away object (e.g a building or mountain) and try to image it with the camera clearly by adjusting the distance between the camera and tube lens. Following shows an example image took by an infinity-corrected camera.

***Fig. 1*** *An example image of an infinity-corrected camera. The mountian in the image is far away from our office.*

When the camera is infinity-corrected, the bottom layer of the system can be placed as shown here:

***Fig. 2*** *A top view of the system's bottom layer which contains camera module.*

In this layer, it has some empty cubes spreaded around in order to support the upper layers.

## Align the illumination laser source
The laser we used is a 638 nm diode laser. In order to get a big illumination spot size, the collimator of the laser is teared down and a 20 mm lens is set in front. Move the laser on its mount back and forth to collimate the laser. Check the beam size in front of the lens as well as far away, it should keep the same size and larger than the mirror area of the DMD.

***Fig. 3*** *The laser beam is collimated by the lens, the beam size doesn't change with the propagation distance.*

## Prepare Fourier mask and align the telescope

The telescope consists of two 50mm achromatic lenses and a fourier mask, which block the zero-order illumination and regenerate the intermediate image of the DMD. The telescope is fixed in the openSIM module.

***Fig. 4*** *The bottom layer of the setup is built with Camera module and some empty cubes.*

A 3D printed Fourier mask is applied in the telescope, which is used to block the zero-order of the illumination. The 3D model of the mask case can be found in the ``STL`` repository. One thin copper wire is splitted from electric cable, first make a small knot on the wire which is roughly the size of the tin drop. Then solder a small drop of soldering tin onto the knot.

***Fig. 5*** *A single copper wire is taken from an electrical cable (left), a knot is crossed on the wire and can easliy add correct size of soldering tin on it.*

Mount the wire on the 3D printed part with the help of glue or fix gum, such as [UHU Patafix](https://www.uhu.de/de/produkt.3311). In order to aviod unexpected reflextion of the soldering tin, we can use black marker pen and paint on the tin drop. At the end, the tin drop should be positioned at the middle of the mask.

***Fig. 6*** *A prepared Fourier mask which has a soldering tin painted with black on it.*

A collimated laser diode (or other light source) is mounted into a single UC2 cube in order to check the alignment of the telescope. Put the laser diode cube beside the telescope (the position of the first reflecting mirror out of the SIM module) and heading to the DMD mirror, if the telescope is good calibrated, the laser beam should illuminate onto the DMD chip with its original spot size.

## Bring the setup to the table

### Setup the Raspberry Pi
The DMD is controlled by Raspberry Pi, when the Raspberry Pi connected with the DMD we need to remote control it with a PC for display images. For transport the generated illunimation images or python code to raspberry pi, using [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) on Windows or [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) on Mac makes it easier.

Turn on the wifi Hotspot with
```
SSID: Blynk
Password: 12345678
```
Turn on the Raspberry Pi and wait until it connects. Note the IP Address of the pi (in our case 192.168.43.9). Connect to the pi with SSH on you computer using the following line:
```
ssh pi@192.168.43.9
```
The default password of Raspberry Pi is ``raspberry``. Then we need to activate the external display of Raspi with the command:
```
export DISPLAY=:0
```
The grating pattern we used is generated by a python script ``pygame_grating.py``. The grating is set in vertical direction and the grating constant is 6 pixel size of the DMD micromirror and rolling 1 pixel distance in each second. You can end the infinite loop with ``Ctrl + C``.

### Adjust the mirrors
The setup has two mirrors to direct the illumination beam to the objective. The aim of adjust the mirrors is to direct the laser beam straightly into the objective. The mirror has three direction flexibilities which can be tilted by the screws behind the kinetic mirror mount. The mirrors should be plugged on the base one by one, and after each mirror the propagation direction of the beam should stay the same.

When raw adjustment is done, set the tube lens and the dichroic mirror at their position, the fourier transform of the DMD image should be located and focused at the position of the back focal plane of the objective. When the python script ``pygame_grating.py`` is running on the Raspberry Pi, three beams should located at the middle of the back focal plane position.

***Fig. 7*** *Three beam pattern should locate at the middle of the back focal plane of the objective.*

Insert the objective cube and linear z-stage with bright LED illumination above the dichroic mirror, use one surface reflecting sample, such as a [negative Thorlabs USAF Target](https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=R3L1S4N). Move some structures of the target into the field of view, and adjust the linear stage, to focus on the structures sharply. At that time, it should be some DMD illumination signal on the sample. (When not, it is recommanded to go back to adjust the direction of the two mirrors, make the propagation direction of the laser beam parallel to the axial direction of the objective.) Keep the target structure sharp and adjust the two mirrors, make the illumination pattern sharp at the sample plane. With a three beam interference, the image generated by ``pygame_grating.py`` with grating constant of 6 pixel size should look like this:

***Fig. 8*** *Three beam interference at the sample plane.*

Then remove the objective from the system, try to move the fourier mask in the telescope to block the zero-order of the illumination. To check the process, hold a small piece of paper at the position of the back focal plan, their should be only two first-order left like this:

</p>

***Fig. 9*** *Using the Fourier mask to block the zero-order illumination. You can easily check the block efficiency  by removing the objective from the system.*

Place the objective back, put again a paper slightly above the sample plane, you should observe two same-shaped beam spot.

***Fig. 10*** *The two beam is interferencing at the sample plane and divergent above the sample plane.*

Apply the target sample back, the two beam interference pattern should be shown on the camera. If not, try to slightly tilt the mirror to refocus the both patterns on the sample plane. A example image is shown as below:
