## Baseplate Design Files

These files were generated using OpenSCAD.

Here you find the following file:
* [10_Base_puzzle_v3.scad](10_Base_puzzle_v3.scad) that can be customised to have the puzzles fit properly. Find the details in [ASSEMBLY Baseplate](../../ASSEMBLY_Baseplate).

If you're looking for more UC2 openSCAD design, have a look at the [BASE CUBE](../../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base/OPENSCAD). 


To start working on it, you have to do the following steps:

* Download the file you want to work with and open it in openSCAD
* Change the design as you need
* Render it, export an STL file and print it
* Let us know about your ideas and updates! ([CONTRIBUTING](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md))
