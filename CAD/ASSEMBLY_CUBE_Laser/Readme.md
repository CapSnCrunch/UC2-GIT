# LASER Mount Cube
This is the repository for the Laser Mount Cube.

To acquire the STL-files use the [UC2-Configurator](). The files themselves are in the [RAW](../RAW/STL) folder. The module can be built using injection-moulded (IM) or 3D-printed (3DP) cubes.

## Purpose
It adapts a laser-pointer to the to the UC2 system.

</p>

The laser-pointer is permanently switched on/off using a 3D printed clamp. It is inserted in a Thorlabs-like adapter which centers the laser on the optical axis. Using a set of rods, this adapter can be mounted inside the base-cube. Having two of these adapters makes the design very robust!

### Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube
* the adapter for the laser can be adjusted to individual laser-pointer diameters
* the 4 screws make centering of the laser w.r.t. the optical axis easy
* Diode-laser, Multimode line profile, Beam
* Peak-Wavelength: ***446 nm***


### Laser Spectrum
The measured sepctrum from the 450nm laser pointer we used for the Light sheet setup can be found below:

### Laser Power
We measured a mean power of ***0.546 mW*** in continuous mode. We used new batteries.

## Parts
The [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1MndGKRCs0LKE5W8VGreCv9DJbQVQv7O6kgLlB6ZmE/edit?usp=sharing) is always the most up-to-date version!

### <img src="../IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
* No support needed in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

The Cube consists of the following components.

#### Default:
* **IM Cube** which houses the insert and adapts it into a UC2 setup.
* **The Laser inserts** which holds the laser and adapts it to the base cube. For optimal performance use two inserts in one cube ([20_Cube_Insert_Laser_Holder_fixed_v3.stl](../RAW/STL))
* **The Laser Clamp** allows keeping the laser switched on without holding it ([30_Laser_Clamp_OnOffSwitch.stl](../RAW/STL))

#### Alternatives:
* **3DP Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([10_Cube_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) and **3DP Lid** which closes the Cube ([10_Lid_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) - find the details in [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base)

## <img src="./IMAGES/A.png" height="40"> Assembly
* Insert the 4 screws in the Laser Mount Adapter and screw them thus far so the they are not visible in the inner hole
* Insert the laser pointer inside the adapter
* Fix the laser by precisely rotate all 4 screws so that the laser pointer is centered
* Place the insert/inserts with the laser inside the cube
* Close the cube accordingly (IM/3DP)
* Done!
* Only insert the batteries before you use the module!

### Tutorial with images
    This tutorial needs an update!

Don't insert batteries in the laser yet!!

1. All parts for this model

</p>

2. Add the button clamp to the Laser to keep the laser on in CW-mode. Put the laser inside the two Laser-inserts. Adding 2 scews to the insert makes it possible to decenter the laser in X/Y.

3. Mount Laser inside the inserts in the cube

4. Align the Laser in X/Y using the two screws

6. Only insert the batteries before you use the module!

## Safety
Never (!) look into the laser pointer! It will damage your eye immediately!

* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LASER! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LASER WITHOUT INTEDED USE
* BEAM HAS TO GO AWAY FROM ONESELF - ALWAYS!
