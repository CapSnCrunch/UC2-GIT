# TUT03: Give your first cube a function - lens as a magnifying glass
([TUT03 of TUTORIALS](../../../TUTORIALS) )  
This is a subsection of the repository for the [Generic Lens Holder Cube](../).

To acquire the STL-files use the [UC2-Configurator](). The files themselves are in the [RAW](../RAW/STL) folder. The module can be built using injection-moulded (IM) or 3D-printed (3DP) cubes.

### Purpose
The Lens Holder insert adapts a lens into the cube.

</p>

## Parts

### <img src="../IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
* No support needed in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

The Cube consists of the following components.

#### Default:
* **IM Cube** which houses the insert and adapts it into a UC2 setup.

For the 40 mm lens linked in additional parts:
* **The 1" Lens Holder with clamp** which holds a lens with 1 inch (25,4 mm) diameter and adapts it to the base cube ([UC2_v3_20_Insert_Lens_holder_40mm_v3.stl](../RAW/STL/UC2_v3_20_Insert_Lens_holder_40mm_v3.stl))

You can generate a holder for any arbitrary lens following the [Thingiverse Customizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4377691). For the other lenses we frequently use, the STL can be found [here](../STL).

* Lens, f' = +40 mm (Artikel 2120) [ðŸ¢‚](https://optikbaukasten.de/)

## <img src="../IMAGES/A.png" height="40"> Assembly
* Mount the lens inside the holder
* Put the clamp in, to hold the lens
* Put hot glue in the groove between the clamp and the holder - this way it will fix it permanently. The glue must never touch the lens!
* Put the Insert in the Cube
* Close the cube accordingly (IM/3DP)
* Done!

### Tutorial with images
:grey_exclamation: This tutorial shows a UC2_v2 cube but the assembly of the insert is still the same. For assembly of the cube (IM/3DP) check the [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base).

1. All parts for this model

</p>

1. Put the lens inside the holder. When using plano-convex lenses, put the plano-surface in the holder with the convex surface in the direction where the clamp will be. That way, your lens will be completely sunken in the holder and therefore more protected from being scratched.

</p>

1. Put the clamp on the rim of the holder a press it firmly. The lens shouldn't be able to move when you're done. Be careful not to touch the surface of the lens!

## Lens as a magnifying glass

<p align="center">
<img src="../IMAGES/UC2_magnifying_glass.png" width="400">
</p>

A magnifying glass is simply a convex lens with small focal length. The magnification is given by

***M=  250 mm/f<sub>lens</sub>*** ,

where 250 mm stands for a so called conventional near-point distance. It is given by accommodation properties of the eye. *f* is the focal length of the lens.

Place the cube with the lens on newspapers or any other small text in such a way that you will look on the text through the lens. Adjust the position of the insert in order to see the text with the highest possible magnification.

Now you can use it as a "reading stone" - the cube will keep the correct distance between the lens and the text and you just shift the cube over it.

Don't touch the optical surfaces - fingerprints and scratches are bad for lenses!

Be careful not to burn yourself with the hot glue gun!
