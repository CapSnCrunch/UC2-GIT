# Camera Cube
This is the repository for the Camera Cube.

To acquire the STL-files use the [UC2-Configurator](https://uc2configurator.netlify.app/). The files themselves are in the [RAW](../RAW/STL) folder. The module can be built using injection-moulded (IM) or 3D-printed (3DP) cubes.

## Purpose
It adapts a standard Raspberry Pi Camera (v1, v2) to the UC2 system.

</p>

The sensor (w/wo lens) is put into an adapter which holds the camera in the center of the cube. The height can be varied by sliding the adapter along the slides. It is designed to eventually hold (fluorescent) filters. The camera need to be fixed with a set of screws. M2Ã—10mm in combination with nuts work best.

### Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube
* camera adapter can be adjusted to individual needs

## Parts
The [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1MndGKRCs0LKE5W8VGreCv9DJbQVQv7O6kgLlB6ZmE/edit?usp=sharing) is always the most up-to-date version!

### <img src="../IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
* No support needed in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

The Cube consists of the following components.

#### Default:
* **IM Cube** which houses the insert and adapts it into a UC2 setup.
* **The Camera Insert** which holds the camera and makes it adaptable to the base-cube ([20_Cube_Insert_RaspiCam_v3.stl](../RAW/STL))

#### Alternatives:
* **3DP Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([10_Cube_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) and **3DP Lid** which closes the Cube ([10_Lid_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) - find the details in [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base)
* The **Sample Holder** in front on the camera is needed in the [In-line holography application](../../APPLICATIONS/APP_INLINE_HOLOGRAM)
* **The Sample holder Insert** that can hold the pinhole in front of the LED ([20_Cube_insert_Sample_holder_v3.stl](../RAW/STL))
* **The Sample holder clamp** that fixes the pinhole in its position ([20_Cube_Insert_Sample_clamp.stl](../RAW/STL))

## <img src="./IMAGES/A.png" height="40"> Assembly
* Mount the flex cable to the raspi-cam
* Mount the camera board to the Camera Insert using the 2 M2 screws
* Fix the position by mounting the two nuts. Take care to not destroy the camera'S PCB
* Take the mounted camera adapter inlet and slide it into the base-cube
* Close the cube accordingly (IM/3DP)
* Done!

### Tutorial with images
:grey_exclamation: This tutorial shows a UC2_v2 cube but the assembly of the insert is still similar. For assembly of the cube (IM/3DP) check the [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base).

1. All parts for this model

</p>

2. Remove the Lens of the raspberry pi camera using the tool which comes with it. Optional: Add a longer camera cable to it.

3. Add the camera to the insert using some M2 crews + nuts. Be careful and try not to destroy the camera! It's fragile.

4. Add the screws - Done!

## Safety
Be careful with the camera's PCB. It's sensible to electronic static discharge!
