# UC2 with 3-holes-cubes

In UC2, blocks are the key elements of each setup. All setup parts can be easily moved and
aligned thanks to the modular UC2 block design like a piece of LEGO. The fundamental design of the unit block is cubic,
and it has 4 holes for screws in the top and bottom surfaces. Screws connect two parts of the cube (lid and base) and
help the cube to attach to the skeleton of the setup, the baseplate. Classical baseplate design has 4 holes in each corner for ball magnets.

Let's try alternative unit block designs and try to improve stability problems of 4-holes-cube design.
In this new block designs, 3 screw holes are used in the top and bottom surfaces of the cube instead of 4
screws holes and two additional magnet holes are added to the base plate.

Luckily, we can use already printed inserts from 4-holes-cube setups. They have same dimensions and can be usable for our new cube designs.

We designed new cube blocks. Let's build a simple microscope setup and see the differences between 3-holes-cube and classical UC2 4-holes-cube design.
In a finite correction optical system, the objective lens forms an intermediate image by itself. Light passing through the objective is directed toward the intermediate
image plane and converges at that point, undergoing constructive and destructive interference to produce an image.
A simple finite-corrected microscope is built with a light source like LED lamp or laser, sample, lens, mirror, and
camera (Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2) as a detector.

# Result

Dreams vs. Reality

Our idea behind making new design for cube block was to obtain a more stable connection between a cube block and a
base plate with a triangular connection diagram. But in practice, this idea was impractical because of a gap between magnets and screws on the plane. Cubes were not stable on the base
plate.

# A short Message For the next UC2 Designers
You see the beauty of UC2. We had an idea and tried that ad shared our experiences with you. UC2 is an open-source and improvable project for everybody. If you have any new idea, let's try and share your experiences with us.
Keep dreaming and improving UC2 with next versions <3
