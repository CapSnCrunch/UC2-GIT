# PolarBOX

The PolarBOX is an UC2 ready-to-use toolbox that can be built 10 different polarization experiments using 3D printed blocks. You just need basic and cheap components for preparing your own PolarBOX.  

*What is the polarization of the light?*

I can hear the questions inside your head (Yes, I read your mind). We live with unpolarized light around us in our daily life: sunlight. Light is an electromagnetic wave. Electric field vectors of sunlight/unpolarized light vibrate in all planes randomly along the direction of propagation. When the electric field vectors are limited using a filtration mechanism to a single plane, linearly or plane polarized light is obtained with respect to the direction of propagation. In the plane-parallel or plane-polarized light, all waves vibrate in a single plane along the propagation direction.

Most common filtration mechanism is using the polarizing filter. Polarizers can be used to filter, modify, or analyze the polarization states of light in an optical system. The electric field of light can be polarized as parallel to the plane of incidence, p-polarized, or perpendicular to this plane, s-polarized using a linear polarizer.  

Let's see s-polarized light in the scheme:
