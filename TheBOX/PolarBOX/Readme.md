# Polar BOX

The PolarBOX is an UC2 toolbox that can be built 10 different polarization experiments.






TheBOX is a number of optical experiments compiled into a ready-to-use box. We created three variants for different levels of knowledge and skills. SimpleBOX covers the basic experiments of ray optics for secondary and high schools. CourseBOX  teaches the core principles of microscopy from a simple lens to laser scanning confocal microscopy. FullBOX is meant to be used by university students and researchers for the everyday labwork or advanced courses.
