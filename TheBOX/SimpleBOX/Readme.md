# Simple BOX
SimpleBOX, equipped with passive components only, covers the basic experiments of ray optics. It is compact and cheap and therefore can be handed to children of all age. It completely covers the classical optics experiments of 7th-8th grade with an overhang to the high school experiments.

That's how it could look like:

Useful for Workshops. Get back to us if you want to organize one together with us!

**Coming soon:** [MiniBOX](MiniBOX.md) with 8 cubes only but the same amount of experiments as the SimpleBOX! Price is reduced, effect remains.
